dot chain method----for example-.trim().goToLowerCase-----this results the input of trim and get an output and the resulted output from the trim becomes the input to the gotolowercase.

- if it is same datatype then the dotchain continues .the datatype changes means the dot chain stops.
- array of object is the most common using method..
  arrays are also represented as objects and the datatypes of array is object.
-     Array has index and values.
-     Object has keys and values.
-     there is no datatype for array
-     the data type of array is object.
-     let will allow reassign and const will doesnt allow reassign.
-     let will allow redeclare ad const will doesnt allow redeclare
-      but var will allow both redeclare and reassign.
-       in const the base address is not to be changed
-      ...- is said to be spread operator it helps and merge an array.
-       no duplicate keys are allowed in object.
-       last key overrides the previous key in object
- ## Array destructing and Object destructing:

-        default value is taken when there is no value given to the t3 is undefined.
-          - for example--const [t1,t2,t3]=[100,200] here the output is 100,200,undefined.
- ## null is also a value therfore null is also output.
-       if we put const[,t1,t2,t3=null]=[10,40,60]here , will skip the first value that is 10 and the resulting output is t1=40,t2=60 and t3=null
- ### Spread operator merge two arrays or objects
- ### Rest operator--collect rest of the values of arrays or objects

-        equal to left is rest and equal to right is spread    ------left(rest)=right(spread)

 - ## day-8
- important terms in functions
  no of arg is less than the no of params then the params became undefined
  no of arg is more than the no of params then the arg is skipped
 -  ### use of function
   - reuse the logic
   -  update in one place
-  ### Philosophy 
       - make it work and then make it better
