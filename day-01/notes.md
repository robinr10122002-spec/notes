# Intro of first day Full Stack Webdevelopment class

## History of Internet:

- Mosaic was the first browser and it was created by PHD scholars and also for the Millitary forces to communicate with others.

## First Internet War:

- Netscape VS Internet Explorer- IE **WONS**
  ## Second Internet War
  - Google chrome VS IE- Google chrome **WONS**
  ## Difference between Webapp and Website:
  - ### WebApp:
  - Webapp is a dynamic one.
  - It doesn't need phone storage.
  - Advantage of Webapp:
    - It gives cross-platform support.
  - Disadvantage of Webapp:
    - Webapp affects the others experience.
  - ### Example for Webapp:
    - **Youtube,Instagram,Twitter,etc** - If we watch something means next time it shows the relevant searches.
  - ### Website:
    - Website is a static one.
    - Landing pages are called Website
  - Advantage of Website:
    - It doesn't affect the others experience.
  - Disadvantage of Website:
    - It not gives cross-platform support.
  - ### Example for Website:
    - **Wikipedia**
  - **NOTE** : Browser only allows webassembly language like **_Html,css and Javascript_**.
  - ## THREE LAYERS ARCHITECTURE:
  - > **Front-End**
  - > **Back-end**
  - > **Database**
  - ## Client-Server Architecture:
    - Client search for a data and it gives request to the server and then the server will respond the data to the client.
  - ## DNS Server(Domain Name System):
    - DNS is a contact application.
    - Index.html is the first request send from the client side to the server.
    - After that it send css and images request to the server side.
    - PC is also a **Server**.
    - **Hoisting** helps to load the html,csss and javascript file to the server.
    - ### For example: **_GO DADDY_**.
    - Domain name converts into ipaddress and send it to the server.
  - ### For example:
    - First we copy the \ **www.google.com**\.
    - Second thing go to _cmd_ and type\ **ping www.google.com** \.
    - And then it shows the google's ip address and that ip address is same .It doesn't change the ip address and again we can copy the ip address and paste it in the browser it will works.
    - > **_Propogation_** means if we buy one server and it has one ip address and it connects the nearby addressess and it takes some time based on their availability to connect with the worldwide servers.
    - > > Approximately it will takes **_24 Hours_**.
  - #### Ipv4 VS Ipv6:
    - Ipv6 has more number of ip addressess compared to the Ipv4.
  - ### Routers:
    - Routers also acts as a mediator to the dns server.
    - Routers also has an ip address.
    - If the ip address change means dynamic and it doesn't change means static.
    - And the another two types of routers are **_PUBLIC and PRIVATE_**.
    - When we connect router as public to the server means that time the router acts as a public router and two or three client uses the same router means it sends different ip address privately to the clients side.
  - ### Example for public router:
    - Normally using of our home internet.
  - ### Example for public router:
    - Companies internet.
  - ### Ip address VS Mac address:
    - In ip address we can change the address but in mac we can't change the address.
    - Mac is like an **IMEI** number.It does't change the address.
  - ### TCP:
    - Tcp is more **_reliable_** than compare to the udp.
    - It works on **_three way handshake_** process(sync).
    - It is unicast.
  - ### Example for TCP:
    - **_EMAILING_** -if we send one information from one side to other means we can check whether it is he for each time and we can trust the process to share our informations.
  - ### UDP:
    - Udp shares information faster than the Tcp.
    - It doesn't check whether it is a trustable server.
    - It is both unicast and dicast.
  - ### Example for UDP:
    - **_YOUTUBE LIVES_**-People put live stream in youtube but only few people will watch the live and another example is **_RADIO_**.
  - ### Image Link Step:
    - I like [**_joker_**](https://wallpapers.com/images/featured-full/joker-k6u5fleppdl2ajfb.jpg).
    - My fav sport [**_CRICKET_**](https://www.google.com/imgres?q=cricket%20images&imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2F1200x%2F1f%2F5e%2F3b%2F1f5e3b83a62f2b35382e388cc0100f11.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fin.pinterest.com%2Fpin%2F745205069630244872%2F&docid=dbNzo5v27RFx9M&tbnid=55hADPPO-gyvVM&vet=12ahUKEwiUgpyFjLaRAxWw7zgGHVyZOGsQM3oECHoQAA..i&w=474&h=592&hcb=2&ved=2ahUKEwiUgpyFjLaRAxWw7zgGHVyZOGsQM3oECHoQAA).
  - # DAY 2 OF TRAINING:
  - #### PWA:
    - It means we open anyone website and then we need to install it in phone and then we can use it as a native apps.
    - ##### For example:
           -Offline games.
  - ## MONOPHOLY:
    - It means one who is very dominant in a particular domain .
  - ## TLDR:
    - .dev, .com
  - ## NETWORK:
    - If two devices connected then it is said to be network.
    - It connects maximum three devices.
  - ## INTRANET:
    - Bunch of network that are connected in a particular area then it is said to be an intranet.
    #### For example:
        - Collage Laboratory.
  - ## INTERNET:
    - All intranet connected means then it is said to be an internet.
    - It is made up of an optical fibre cable and that are connected through submarines for connecting all the intranet and to communicate tho worlwide.
    - It transmit light through the optical fibre.
    - If we send big type of data means sometimes it will not receive on  
      the receiver side it will break the big data into small peices and then it sends .so it improves the reliability.
  - ## HTTP:
    - It stands for hypertext transfer protocol.
    - Protocol stands for rules.
    - The first version of http is 0.9.
    - and then 1.0
    - and then 1.1
    - after 18 years http 2.0 came
    - and then 3.0.
  - ### Rule of http 1.0:
    - For every request we need a handshake and then it will respond.
    - Separate connection.
  - ### Rule of http 1.1:
    - For every 6 request we need one handshake tcp connection.
    - It is persistent-open connection.
    - Head of line blocking it means if three request sending at a time the server wait for three requests and then only it will respond.It leads to more time to respond.
- ### Rule of http 2.0:
  - If we send three request at a time but only two can receive to the server means it doesn't wait for the third one,the two request will responded to the client and the third one will be come late.
- ## MDN:
      - For studying all types of notes in website type that website.mdn.
      - It is an official website.
      -  For example html.mdn
  - ### CRUD:
    - create-post.
    - read-get.
    - update-put.
    - delete-delete.
  - #### Browsers engines:
        1- every browser has an engine.
        2-under the hood- inside the browser how this will happens.
  - ### Types of engines:
    - Rendering engines.
    - js engines.
  - #### Parser:
    - It only converts the html,css,js code into dom tree and cssom tree.
    - v8 takes care of html and css parser to dom.
    - jS takes care of javacript parser to cssom.
  - ### HTTP STATUS CODE:
        1- 100 means INFORMATIONAL.
        2- 200 means SUCCESSFUL.
        3- 300 means REDIRECTIONAL.
        4- 400 means CLIENT SIDE ERROR.
        5- 500 means SERVER SIDE ERROR.
  - ### HTTP VERIFICATION CERTIFICATE PROCESS:
    - This is the method of finding the [verification certificate of any website](<video controls src="WhatsApp Video 2025-12-13 at 10.08.22 AM-1.mp4" title="Title"></video>)
  - ### CSS TERMS:
    - These are [few terms of css terms shown in this image.](<Screenshot (2).png>)
  - ### CSS SHORTCUTS:
    - ( SHIFT+! )- DOCTYPE.html
    - ( CTRL+ /)-COMMAND
    - (WINDOWS+.) -EMOJI.
  - ### TYPES OF DATA TYPES:
    - Primitive data type.
    - Non-Primitive data type.
  - #### Primitive data type:
          - Primitive consists of single value.
  - #### Non-Primitive data type:
          - It contains of collection of values.
  - ### OPERATORS:
    - +,-,\*,/ are called operators.
    - 8+3 in this 8 and 3 are operands.
    - Operator operates on operands.
  - ### TYPES OF OPERATORS:
    - #### Arithmetic operators.
    - +,-,\*,/,% these are called arithmetic operators.
  - #### Assignment operator:
    - **_=_** is said to be an assignment operator.
  - #### Comparison operator:
    - <,>,==,>=,=<,these are said to be an comparison operators.
  - #### Logical operator:
    -& ,|| are said to be logical operators.
  - #### Concatination:
        - Adding of two strings is said to be a concatination.
  - Programming notes for operators[img](console.log("Hello, 🌏");

// +, - , \*.... -> operators
// 5, 3 -> operands
// Operator operates on operands

// Types of operators
// 1. Arithmetic Operators
console.log(5 + 3); // 8
console.log(5 - 3); // 2
console.log(5 \* 3); // 15
console.log(5 / 3); // 1.6666...

console.log(5 \*\* 3); // 125
console.log(5 % 3); // % -> modulus (Remainder)

// 2. Assignment
var x = 10; // = Assignment operator

// 3. Comparison operators - Always returns boolean

console.log(5 > 3); // true
console.log(5 < 3); // false
console.log(10 == 10); // true
console.log(10 > 10); // false
console.log(10 >= 10); // true
console.log(10 < 10); // false
console.log(10 <= 10); // true
console.log(10 >= 8); // true

var t1 = 8;
var t2 = 10;

console.log(t1 == t2); // false

var t1 = 18;
var t2 = 10;

console.log(t1 != t2); // true

// 4. Logical operators
// var a = true;
// var b = false;

// console.log(a && b); // false

// var a = true;
// var b = true;

// console.log(a && b); // true

var a = false;
var b = true;

console.log(a || b); // true

console.log(4 > 3 || 10 <= 10);
console.log(10 > 9 && 10 < 10);
console.log(!(7 >= 9) || !(5 > 3));
console.log(7 != 8 && 4 >= 3 && 3 != 9 && !(4 > 1));)

- # DAY 3 OF TRAINING:
  - **TYPECASTING OR COERSION**
    -It converts different types of data types and convert into numbers then it is said to be typecasting or coersion.
  - ## TYPES OF COERSION:
    - Implicit coersion.
    - Explicit coersion.
      > - '+' is said to be an overloaded operator.
      > - It can do concatination and addition.
  - ## For example:
    - console.log(5 + "3"); --> '5'+'3' --> '53'--> Output.
    - console.log(5 - '3'); --> '3'--> 3 --> 5 - 3--> 2-Output.
  - ### Implicit coersion:
    - js itself converts the datatype is said to be an implicit coersion.
  - **For example**- console.log(5 + "3"); --> '5'+'3' --> '53'--> Output.
  - ### Explicit coersion:
         - In this we are converting the datatypes by using some terms.They are listed below
         - parseInt
         - parseFloat
         - Number
         - ex code for parseInt--
        console.log(a + parseInt(b)); // 8
    var a = 5;
    var b = "3.68"; // "3.68" -> 3
- #### example for types of explicit coersion:
  - [Explicit code notes](![alt text](<expicit coercion example code.png>))
  - #### Declarations -> Creating a variable
           -  ex: var p;
  - #### ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR:
    - We are assigning a value to the variable.
    - ex- a = 10;
    - Here = is an assignment operator.
    - ### UNDEFINED VS NOTDEFINED:
    - Undefined is a value. (important)
    - eg: var x;
    - Notdefined is an error. (important)
    - avoid null in js.
    - ### For creating pop-up message for the user input:
      - **var name=prompt("ENTER THE NAME");**
    - ### TEMPLATE LITERAL:
    - Better readability.
    - Multiline support.
    - Allow expressions.
    - ${}- these terms are called Interpolation.
    - [Coding image of template literal](<BCS-Training-Dec-2025_Day_03_06_template_literal.js at main · ragavkumarv_BCS-Training-Dec-2025 - Google Chrome 12_15_2025 10_19_17 AM-1.png>)
  - var g1= 5;
  - var g2="5";
  - console.log(g1==g2); the output is "55" it allows coersion.
  - console.log(g1===g2); the output is 0 it doesnt allow coersion.
- **EXPRESSION CAN BE ASSIGNED TO A VARIABLE**
- ## DAY 5 OF TRAINING:
- #### NON-PRIMITIVE DATATYPES:
          - ARRAYS AND OBJECTS WE HAVE SEEN TODAY.
  - #### MATH-METHOD:
  - > Math.ceil()-- returns the nearest highest value.
  - for example-4.8 means it results 5.
  - > Math.floor()--returns the nearest lowest value.
  - for example-4.5 means it return 4;
  - > Math.abs()-- returns only positive values.
  - for example we gives -4 means it results in 4.
- ## TRIM:
  - It removes the unwanted spaces both starting and ending inside the string values.
    - ### TrimStart - It removes the unwanted spaces at the starting side inside the string values.
    - ### TrimEnd- It removes the unwanted spaces at the ending side inside the string values.
    - ### STRINGS are IMMUTABLE i.e it doesn't change.
    - #### DOTCHAIN works on the same datatype present in a block or object.
    - #### REPEAT()--- It helps to repeat the values.
    - #### math.padStart()--- It converts space expect the number count.
    - For example-- we give 90 means math.padStart(10) is totally it allocates 10 spaces from that 2 spaces contains a value and the remaining spaces will be empty. this is said to be padStart.
    - ### ARRAYS are MUTABLE. we can change the data type.
    - ### OBJECT contains keys and values.
      - > FOR NOTES REFER : notes.ragavkumarv.com
      - And we had done some coding in arrays ,strings ,and objects .
  - dry principle-dont repeat yourself.
