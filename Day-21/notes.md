- ## Javascript:
- founder of javascript is Brendan Eich in 1995.
-
- the first version is es1 in 1997 and es2 in 1998.
- he took 10 days to create the javascript.
- created by Netscape in 1995.
- originally called LiveWire then LiveScript.
- IE has rendering engine is jscript.
- NETSCAPE has rendering engine is livescript.
- ECMAScript is the original name of javascipt.
- both Netscape and IE are slightly different but most it works like same.
- Tc39 committee handles javascript.
- Browser engineers develops the new features and he will implement the features.
- ES2015 means ecma script 2015 version. so many features came in 2016
  - for example-destructuring,spread operator,arrow function,let,const,etc.
- any new features came in ecma means we can see it in github---tc39 github or tc39/proposal- in github.
- - ## stages of new features:
- stage 0- idea-desk or straw person.
- stage 1- proposal(describe about the feature and why we need it )
- stage 2-security(it creates plugin) (in this condition they checks whether we need the feature or not or it affects the other features or other browsers) after completing this stage 90 percent completed.
- stage 3- in this stage we use the new feature in BETA version browser.first it checks in the few users in browsers.
- plugin-it likes an adaptor(old browser can also be accessable the new features).so plugin is used.
- Babel is the plugin helps to use the code works in old browsers.it converts and it helps to work in old browsers.
- ## Hoisting:
- javascript is also a compiler language.
- JIT- just in time- is the compiler here.
- ## 2 phases of JIT
-     1.compilation.(in this stage it checks only the declaration part)
-     2.execution.(in this stage only it gives the value for the declaration part)
- in var - we can get undefined.
- but in let and const -we get the error because it works strictly like we cant give any value in the compile phase.
- TDZ(TEMPORAL DEAD ZONE)-this is the zone above the declaration part it will not works due to no declaration for example var a;
- the variable inside the function gets the more preference.(shadowing)
- function declaration gets hoisted.
- function expression gets hoisted.
- ## -Call back function:
- when function takes function as an argument is said to be a callback function.
- TYPES OF CALL BACK FUNCTION:
- synchronous and asynchronous.
- synchronous- it doesnt have any time. eg:map function.
- asynchronous-it involves time. eg:timeinterval.
- **-Thread-** runs where the process is.
- javascript is a single threaded and asynchronous one.
- concurrently doing the task(concurrently means one task is completed and do the another one.)
- **- Process-** is currently which is running.
- ## -STACK:
- first in last out or last in first out.
- ## - QUEUE:
- first in first out or last in last out.
- **-JS ENGINE ONLY WORKS IN CALL STACK PLACE.-**
- WEB API only waits.
- four phases-call stack,web apis,callback queue,event loop.
- event loop check the call stack is empty and the callback queue loop the output into the call stack.
- setTimeout is not the part of javascript and it is the part of the browser and it is the part of webapi.
- native code is the browsers code.
- it takes time means it will be the part of WebApi.
- it does not takes time means it will be the part of call stack.
- event looping helps to push the call back queue when the call stack gets empty.
- ## -Object-methods:
- object.keys(student), object.values(student) and object.entries(student)
