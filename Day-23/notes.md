- ## -ASYNCH AND AWAIT:
- It almost looks like **-SYNCH** code but it is not a synchronous.
- fetch returns promise.
- response also returns promise.
- BEFORE promise we need to put await.
- postman is the tool to test the api.
- **-mockapi.io**website used to create a dummy api.
- - ## TRY & CATCH:

- ## REACT:
- Webpack and Babel acts as a mediator to convert the react code to the html,css and javascript.
- webpack makes a single file and it bundle it .
- babel works as a translator and compiler.
- DX (Developer experience)is better in react,because there are some tool are inbuilt in react and then we can easily use it.
- but in html,css and javascript we need to create the tool and then only we can use it.

we dont put class="mark"-because it doesnt work in jsx(javascript xml)--class is a reserved name...instead of using class we need to put className.
and the another thing is babel convert jsx into js it gets confused.

in jsx the function is said to be a **-COMPONENT**
INSIDE component we have both the UI + LOGIC

## COMPONENT RULES:

1.START with capital(PASCAL CASE.)
PROPS datatype is an object.
