if expects boolean values
while using  if  we can got to comparison operator and logical operator
a= true || false
if(5>4)
a=5>4
math.abs is inbuilt in js---->abs means absolute value.
maths.ceil means if we give 4.1 means it roundoff to the highest value that is 5.
math.floor means if we give 4.5 means it roundoff to the lowest value that is 4
math.round means if we give 4.89 means it roundoff to the nearest value that is 5
other method to get nearest decimal point search it in mdn
the datatype of infinity is a number.
trim remove the unwanted spaces at the starting and ending.
trim start removes the starting unwanted spaces at the starts
trim end reoves the unwanted spaces at the end
strings are immutable(cannot be change).
dot chaining---->  .trim().uppercase().tolowercase()  it works on the same data type like string
.length- to check how many words are there. it gives the output is numbers
when the dot chain cut is when the datatype is changed.
assignment----->other ways to cut the dot chain refer it in google.
console.log("hi".repeat(10));
the output repeats hi in 10 time
.padStart(10);---->whether the output is 90 means it lefts 8 spaces and then print 90 that is the total is 10
