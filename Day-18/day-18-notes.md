- # -MEDIA QUERY:
  - Syntax : - -->@media (width>300px){background-color:red}---it must be used in css. - this width is the devices width. - 300px is the mobiles width in the condition,
  - ## pseudo-class-selectors:
    - syntax--> ( .container >li:nth-child(1){color:red} ).
    - here after the li if we give single colon(:)->means pseudo class selector
    - if we give double colon(::)->means pseudo element selector .it is used to access the element.
    - ex:(3n+4)means here 3 is the difference
    - 4 is the starting position.
    - n starts from 0 the position
    - if(n+5)-->means starting position is 5.(starts from 5 and ends till the infinity)
    - if(-n+5)-->means starting position is 5(starts from 5 and ends till the 0 or in reverse order)
    - # Types of pseudo class selector:
    - p-nth-of-child(2)-->means it prints the child of 2 nd element of p.
    - p- last-of-child-->means it prints the last p element in the p.
    - p-nth-of-type(2)-->means it prints the which type is it and p is the type then p of 2 nd element
    - p- last-of-type-->means it prints the last type of p element in the p.
    - first-child
    - last-child
    -
- # -.box:hover{color:red,background:url}
- anything we can do in the hover if we hover over a image or anything while we touch the element or image
- .box:hover{transform:scale(1.2)} -->(1.2) it means when we hover over it it will transform into 1.2 ratio it will increases.
- color will animate but bg color will not animate.
- box{transition: 1s transform} or box{transition: 0.2s all} the hovered image will be scaled and it shows the difference in 0.2 seconds in general.
-
- # box:active{color:blue} and important thing is transition must be given to the element like example(.box{transition:is all ease in and out})
- box:hover{transform:scale(1.5)translateY(-40px)translateX(40px) }
- box:hover{transform:rotate, border-radius:50%, background:orange, background:url(), transform:rotate(360degree)}
- ease starts speed and end is slow
- ease starts slow and end is speed
- ease-in-out starts slow and ends slow.
- ## transform.mdn (refer it).
- ## - Every browser has its own user agent.
- ## Inherit:
- in "a" tag it does not inherit because it is in the last specificity.
- so we need to put-->>a{color:inherit}

## DOM(Document Object Method):
- doc(object)is to accesss the DOM.
- html parser will convert html into dom.
- example--><h1>Awesome<h1> in this one we need to access the html element in javascript so we are putting here
- ## const result=document.querySelector()
- 
- ### document.querySelectorAll()--> 
- it does three works like gettingElementById,gettingElementsByClassName and gettingElementByTagName.
 
- ## uses of queryselector:
- 1. NodeList-forEach.
- 2. supports-complex combinator.
